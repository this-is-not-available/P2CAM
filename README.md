# Portal 2 Custom Asset Manager
P2CAM is your go-to application for installing, uninstalling, creating and viewing custom Portal 2 mapping assets!

It uses the .p2asset format to quickly share your high-quality assets effortlessly.
I aim for P2CAM to become a one-stop place for anything custom asset related, as well as making checking the required credit for each asset effortless.

All custom assets are installed and mounted from ```Portal 2/portal/custom``` leading to them being easily manipulated.

Anyone that wants to contribute to this project is free to do so!

## Current features

* Asset browser
    *  Lists all installed custom assets
    *  Can view the name, description, author, credit, version and the preview image for each asset
    *  Can install .p2asset assets from a dropdown menu
* Asset creator
    * An intuitive UI for creating .p2asset files
    * Can set everything you can view in the asset browser and lets you select asset files and tags as well.

## Planned features

* Search
    * Would let you search tags, description, title and asset type in the asset browser for quick retrieval
* Asset preview
    * Similar to [VPKEdit's](https://github.com/craftablescience/VPKEdit) previewing features, allowing you to know exactly what you're installing
* Marketplace (?)
    * Online marketplace similar to the Steam Workshop or NPM to remove the middleman from the asset retrieval process.
    * Users can upload their own custom assets for everyone to use!
* Many more options!
